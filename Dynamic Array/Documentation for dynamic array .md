# Dynamic Array Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a dynamic array data structure in Java.

## Overview

A dynamic array, also known as an array list, is a resizable array that grows or shrinks automatically as elements are added or removed. It offers constant-time access to elements and dynamic resizing, making it a versatile data structure for managing collections of elements.

## Features

- **Resizable Array**: The dynamic array automatically grows or shrinks as elements are added or removed, providing flexibility in managing collections of varying sizes.
  
- **Efficient Access**: Offers constant-time access to elements, allowing for efficient retrieval and modification of elements at any position within the array.

## Contents

- `DynamicArray.java`: Contains the implementation of the dynamic array data structure.
- `DynamicArrayTest.java`: Includes unit tests for validating the functionality of the dynamic array implementation.
